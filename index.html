            <img src="intro.jpg" alt="intro img">
            <p>Two-Factor Authentication is an extra layer of security used to ensure that people
                trying to gain access to an online account are who they say they are. Users enter 
                their username and password. Then, instead of immediately logging in, they will be 
                required to provide another piece of information.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>As digital threats become more advanced, the traditional username and password 
                combination is no longer sufficient to secure online accounts. Two-Factor Authentication 
                adds an extra layer of security, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access. 
                Studies show that enabling 2FA can block over 99.9% of automated attacks on account credentials.
