                <h2>SMS-Based 2FA</h2>
                <p>This method sends a code to the user's mobile phone via SMS, which they 
                    must enter to access their account. While convenient, it's vulnerable 
                    to SIM swap attacks.

                <h2>Authenticator Apps</h2>
                <p>Apps like Google Authenticator or Authy generate time-limited codes. 
                    They're more secure than SMS because they're not tied to the phone's SIM 
                    card.

                <h2>Hardware Tokens</h2>
                <p>Physical devices that generate a login code at the push of a button. They 
                    offer a high level of security but can be less convenient due to the need 
                    to carry the device.
